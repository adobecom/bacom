# Bacom
The Franklin based project for business.adobe.com. Based off of milo-college.

## Contributing
Please carefully review the [contributing doc](/CONTRIBUTING.md) *before* beginning development. Understanding the requirements will help facilitate a smooth contribution process.

## Developing
1. Install the [Helix CLI](https://github.com/adobe/helix-cli): `sudo npm install -g @adobe/helix-cli`
2. Run `hlx up` this repo's folder. (opens your browser at `http://localhost:3000`)
3. Open this repo's folder in your favorite editor and start coding.

### Husky Pre-Commit
1. After pulling the main branch, make sure to run `npm install` to get the husky pre-commit package.
2. Husky will run the linter and the test suite before your commit, and will not accept the commit if the either tool has errors or test failures. 
3. To bypass this, add the `--no-verify` flag after your commit message:
```sh
git commit -m "First" --no-verify
```

## Testing Milo Changes on Bacom Pages
1. Run 'hlx up' in this folder to ensure the bacom site is running locally. 
2. Make changes in milo, and then from the milo folder, run `npm run libs`.
3. Milo will run at:
```
http://localhost:6456
```
4. On your `localhost:3000/` or the `main-<project>-<owner>` versions of your site, add the URL params: `?milolibs=local`
5. You should see milo changes occuring on bacom pages.
6. When needing to test on a bacom page while making a PR for milo, add the URL params: `?milolibs=<name-of-milo-branch>`to your test URLs.

## Creating New Blocks
When creating new blocks, first vet any requirements/author-experience in milo-community. There may be a way to acheive your goals with what currently exists in milo. 

## Testing
```sh
npm run test
```
or:
```sh
npm run test:watch
```
This will give you several options to debug tests. Note: coverage may not be accurate.

## Linting
To run the linter run:
```sh
npm run lint
```
To lint just js or css files, run
```sh
npm run lint:css
```
or:
```sh
npm run lint:js
```
If you need to lint just one file, you can run:
```sh
npx eslint file1.js
```

## Logging
When logging do not use `console` but instead use `window.lana.log`, these logs will then be visible in Splunk. 
Use tags to help filter logs. Tags should have the severity, see below, and the module/block name. 
Tags should provide context, categorization, or help in filtering, etc.

Severity:
```
info = network issues or extra details to identify important information.
warn = authoring related mis-configurations or similar - this could lead to generating tickets.
error = actual error ( ex. cannot read Y of undefined ) - this could lead to generating tickets / CSOs depending on context.
```
Work with OPS to generate automatic tickets / CSOs, for example if an error causes the page or block not to render.

Example Logging:
```js
window.lana.log('message', 'info, block-name');
```
